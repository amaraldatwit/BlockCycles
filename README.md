# BlockCycles

BlockCycles is a block puzzle game in which both the puzzle board and the peices move. The board is split into both static and none static board elements. Static elements are inactive till the none static board touches them allowing piece placement in these sections. Due to the nature of how this puzzle function there are multiple ways in which a puzzle can be solved.



## Features
1. Main menu and level select screen
2. Currently has 1 level
3. Level has both moveable parts and static parts that activate when touching the main board
4. 7 peices of blocks to choose from that can be rotated and placed
5. A win screen that displays when the user finshes the puzzle

## Getting Started
### Usage
Our project is still just a unity prototype at the moment due to the fact that we would like to add more levels before we mark it as complete. So to be able to run the game the user must clone the game folder called BlockCycles then open that folder with unity. From there the user must navigate to the scenes folder and open up the main menu scene then hit play.

Once playing the game some of the basic controls are:
* Use spacebar to rotate the game board
* Use numbers 1-7 to select a block
* Use r to rotate blocks
* Use left click to place a block
